## Create the most basic, simple and valid HTML file called base_index.html

The page should contain:

- a DOCTYPE
- a head:
  - with a title
- a body

**Tips:** don’t forget to read all concept pages…

Test the webpage with the official HTML Validator. You will see that it is not happy!

First things first, fix the code in base_index.html so that it is valid.

You will see that the validator then becomes much happier!

## 1. Make a cool first webpage

Copy your file base_index.html to index.html

Add in the body of the page:

- at least 4 paragraphs;
- headings (titles) of level 1, 2 and 3, which are represented by <h1>, <h2> and <h3> tags;
- a clickable image of your choice (you can use the <https://www.holbertonschool.com/holberton-logo.png> image, or another one you find on the internet by using its full URL); and it may link to any URL online that you want.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: alx_html_css
- Directory: html_basic
- File: index.html
