# 0. Some early styling

Copy into this folder index.html and tweets.html that you created in the previous project:

- Create an empty styles.css.
- Create the file base.css and set the content of this file

In each of your HTML files, add these 2 lines within the `<head>` tag (do not confuse with the `<header>` tag!):

`<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">`

`<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">`

If you refresh your webpages in your browser, they should now look a bit better!

We just told your webpages to use the CSS rules described in those two files, and to apply them to your HTML code.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: alx_html_css
- Directory: css_basic
- File: base.css, styles.css, index.html, tweets.html
