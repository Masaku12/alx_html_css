# 0. Some early styling

Copy into this folder index.html and tweets.html that you created in the previous project:

- Create an empty styles.css.
- Create the file base.css and set the content of this file

In each of your HTML files, add these 2 lines within the `<head>` tag (do not confuse with the `<header>` tag!):
`<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">`
`<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">`
